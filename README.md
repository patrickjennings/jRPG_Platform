# jRPG_Platform
A simple RPG created using Java AWT. Modeled after RPGs from
the 90s like Final Fantasy 7.

# Introduction
Truely, a blast from the past. This was a project I worked
on in the early 2000s when I was just learning object oriented
design. Obviously, I hadn't the programming experience I have
today. That being said, it is amazing that this still
compiles and runs properly.
